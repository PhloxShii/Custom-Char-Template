* A custom character template for FNF v0.5x!

* You don't gotta credit me for this if you use it but it'd be nice if you did :)

# How to make cool swaggy custom char

* go into data/players and rename custom.json (or copy and paste it) and edit it to your hearts content (not gonna go through what everything means)

* go into images/charSelect and rename the "customChill" folder (or copy and paste it) and replace "custom" with your characters name

* OPTIONAL: make sprites in adobe animate and export them as a sprite atlas

* go into images/freeplay/icons and place your character icon there (USE "custompixel.png" as a base if you want!)
